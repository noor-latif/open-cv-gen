# CV Tailoring Dashboard - Cursor Rules

## Verification Before Completion

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before declaring any implementation "complete" or "ready to use", you MUST:

1. **Run the verification test script**:
   ```bash
   uv run python test_app.py
   ```
   All tests must pass (7/7) before declaring completion.

2. **Verify the application can start**:
   ```bash
   uv run python run.py
   ```
   The app should start without errors (you can interrupt after confirming it starts).

3. **Check for common issues**:
   - All required files exist (templates, app modules, config.json)
   - Dependencies are installed (`uv sync`)
   - No import errors
   - Flask routes are accessible
   - Templates can be rendered

4. **If any test fails**:
   - Fix the issue immediately
   - Re-run tests until all pass
   - Never say "ready to use" if tests fail

## Project Structure

- Flask app in `app/` directory
- Templates in `templates/` directory
- Static files in `static/` directory
- Application data in `applications/` and `cv_history/` directories
- Configuration in `config.json`
- Test script: `test_app.py`

## Dependencies

- Use `uv` for package management (not pip)
- Use `uv run` instead of `python` directly
- Required: Flask, OpenAI SDK, Playwright, BeautifulSoup4

## Testing Checklist

Before saying "ready to use", verify:
- [ ] All modules import without errors
- [ ] Storage initializes correctly
- [ ] AI client can be created
- [ ] Flask app can be instantiated
- [ ] All routes return 200 status codes
- [ ] All templates exist and can be rendered
- [ ] Base CV template exists
- [ ] Application can start without errors
- [ ] **API connection works** - Run `uv run python test_api_connection.py` and verify it passes
  - If API test fails with 404, the gateway URL is likely incorrect
  - Official Vercel Gateway: `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1`
  - Custom gateways must be accessible and end with `/v1`
